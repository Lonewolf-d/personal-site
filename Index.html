         <h3>Coding/web and app development ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§</h3>
         <p>Since I was little I have always wanted to be involved in big things that will change the world, <br>
            So I decided that I was gonna be a medical doctor and that is working quite well for me as a med student.<br>
            I have always been interested in programming and coding, I see it to be so cool and a skill worth learning and mastering. <br>
            I Just started this journey recently and so far so good, it has been the best decision I have made this year, this is my first website and I seriously enjoy spending my time writing codes.<br>
            This is the beginning of my journey and I am looking forward to developing and building anything I want to. I have mastered HTML,CSS and I am on my way to BOOTSTRAP and JAVASCRIPT. </p>

         <h3>Drummingüòçüòç</h3>
         <p>I love drumming, I started at an early age of 5 years with the typical african drums.<br>Life was good then, don't get me wrong
         life is still good, just that you know, Adult life is the not same as life as a child with no worries. <br> I am a catholic, so then we use to go to block rosary, where we pray the rosary, sing, drum, dance. lol
         it was so fun.<br> I enjoyed the drumming and dancing part than the prayer part, Don't get me wrong I pray too, just that I really love to talk to GOD in secret, just me and my God.<br>
          Well my life as a drummer did not end there. I got into the boarding school (Marist brother's juniorate) and continued my life as a drummer.<br>
        I was in the choir, and I was in the band group too also <em>IGBA NDI EZE</em> Been a while since I drummed though,But once a drummer always a drummer.</p>
